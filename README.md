# Fractal Simulation

Just a bunch of particles moving about randomly and when they collide, they stick together.
Now It seems like if you let this simulation run for a while, you get a fractal like shape
at the end of the simulation which is cool. You can change the dimensions of the window and
the number of particles produced to mess around with the different types of patterns that
show up.

The more particles you add, the worse each iteration takes. Also note that this simulation
is still extremely buggy but it does work for the most part!
